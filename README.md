# go4it
A Connect-Four type game

deployed on heroku at:

go4it.herokuapp.com

Developed during Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp with a team of four. Continued work post-DBC to add additional game logic.


Notes-
October 2015: Flexbox was removed and Go4It is now viewable in all browsers. The game also now reloads after a winner has been alerted.

July 2015: this game should only be viewed in the Chrome browser due to use of Flexbox. My current goal is to rewrite the css so that the game can be viewed properly in most/all browsers.
